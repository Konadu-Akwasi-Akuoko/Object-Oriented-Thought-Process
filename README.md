# The Object-Oriented Thought Process - Book Notes

*This is my summary of **The Object-Oriented Thought Process, Second Edition** by Matt Weisfeld. This summary helps me learn and serves as a quick reference. It does not replace the book, so I recommend buying and reading it if you want to understand the concepts better. Use this repository as a guide and a reference only.*

**Please send me a DM by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akuoko_konadu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akuoko-konadu/) if you are the publisher, and you want this repository to be private. I will change the settings accordingly.**
