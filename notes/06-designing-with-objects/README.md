# Designing With Objects

You can create both good and bad OO designs just as easily as you can create both good and bad non-OO designs. A system can be defined as classes that interact with each other. Proper design practices have evolved throughout the history of software development, and there is no reason you should not take advantage of the blood, sweat, and tears of your software predecessors, whether they used OO technologies or not.

## Design guidelines

Generally, a solid OO design process includes the following steps:

1. Doing the proper analysis
2. Developing a statement of work that describes the system
3. Gathering the requirements from this statement of work
4. Developing a prototype for the user interface
5. Identifying the classes
6. Determining the responsibilities of each class
7. Determining how the various classes interact with each other
8. Creating a high-level model that describes the system to be built
