# Building Objects and Object-Oriented Design

There is a major difference between inheritance and composition. Although they allow us to have a relationship between a child and a parent, the two are inherently not the same.

Although it is true that inheritance is a relationship between two classes, what is really happening is that a parent is created that incorporates the attributes and methods of a child class.However, composition is a different situation. Composition represents interactions between distinct objects.

This chapter focuses on how composition is different from inheritance.

## Composition Relationships

We have already seen that composition represents a part of a whole. Although the inheritance relationship is stated in terms of is-a, composition is stated in terms of has-a. We know intuitively that a car “has-a” steering wheel.
