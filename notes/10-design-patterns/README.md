# Design Patterns

Throughout history, humans have used patterns in many aspects of life, including engineering. These patterns go hand-in-hand with the holy grail of software development: software reuse. Patterns lend themselves perfectly to the concept of reusable software development. Because object-oriented development is all about reuse, patterns and object-oriented development go hand-in-hand.

## Why Design Patterns?

In the book A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction, they define design patterns as: “Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.”
